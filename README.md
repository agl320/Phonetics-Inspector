# Phonetics Inspector
Takes in a string or list of strings and returns basic phonotactic information.
Can also roughly translate English words into German cognate via simple rules (not correct translation). 

Created primarily to aid in introductory linguistic classes.

TODO:
- GUI completion
- Add ability/remove to add custom IPA symbols
